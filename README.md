This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# research-match
Include a few sentences about the intention of your app and how you are 
incorporating filter, sort, and aggregation using your theme.

The intention of this app is to help users find researchers that match their 
interests. The app will have a list of research papers that users can filter and sort based on their interests. The app will also have an aggregator that will show the total number of research papers that match the user's interests.

App functionality
At least 2 filtering categories that work as expected
At least 1 sorting category that works as expected

The app includes a way to sort researcher cards by alphabetical order of the
research area. They can be filtered in ascending and descending order.

A button at the top of the page allows the user to reset the filters and sorts.

Users can add researcher cards to their list of favorites. The aggregator at the
right side of the page will update to show the researchers in the list of 
favorites. Once added to the list of favorites, each researcher has a corresponding
button that allows the user to remove the researcher from the list of favorites.


Includes at least 12 Item cards with all required parts (i.e: image, name, button, etc.)
Filter & sort are compatible and work in combination
